#### Final Project

<h1>Change of Plans</h1>

<img src="./final_original.jpg" width="600px"> 
<br>This was the original plan for my final project: the auto-adjusting dropper post. I had changed the method of detecting whether the bike was uphill or downhill to detection via accelerometer. I was planning to attach the accelerometer to the "bike" (the thing with two wheels next to each other, which was going to have a third non-driven wheel at the front, like a Tuk-Tuk). So, the "bike" would need to have a power source attached to its motor, which would need to be driven remotely via ESP32, and would need an accelerometer attached to it relaying information to another ESP32, which would then actuate a stepper motor up and down depending on whether it was going uphill or downhill - it was a lot. So much so that it simply was not feasible to do all this on top of preparing for my final exam for Calc II. I knew I had to change my final project. </br>

<br>But, before I dropped my original plans, I figured out how to drive a motor based by turning a potentiometer. So, I decided to incorporate into my new plan: to build a stepper motor-driven four-bar linkage, like the ones found on mountain bikes. I decided to use the design I had already come up with (see Project Proposal: Idea 1) </br>
