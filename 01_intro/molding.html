####CNC & Molding

This is the documentation for my learning of how to CNC & mold. I chose to CNC my mold out of a wax block with an SRM-20.

<img src="./molding_1_CAD.jpg" width="370px"> 
<br> I prepared a CAD file in FUsion and exported as an STL onto a hard drive. </br>

<img src="./molding_2_program.jpg" width="370px"> 
<br> I then loaded that file onto the MIT mods page on the lab's iMac, and tried to run the program to get it to cut. It didn't work at first because I followed the instructions on the video demo - apparently I wasn't supposed to do that - I was meant to follow the other instructions in the "Roughing Pass" section of the SRM-20 Mill tutorial instead. Thank you Nathan for clarifying this for me during lab on Sunday and for showing me how to run the machine. </br>

<br> The mill working its magic. </br>

<img src="./molding_3_mixing.jpg" width="370px"> 
<br> While the mill was milling, I mixed the mixture of goo that I will be using to mold my mold. I mixed the blue and pink goo in a 1:1 ratio, making a purple goo. </br>

<br> The bottles of the goo in question. </br>

<img src="./molding_5_waxblock.jpg" width="370px"> 
<br> After I finished mixing, I went to pick up my block of wax, which the machine had finished milling at this point. The shape didn't come out as elegantly as I had wanted it to, but it's on me for making my CAD file's dimensions too small. That said, it's still more than usable, despite its appearance - sort of like me. </br>

<img src="./molding_6_goo_inside.jpg" width="370px"> 
<br> I put the goo inside of the wax block and waited for it to congeal (?). It hasn't congealed yet as of writing this - it takes 6 hours to do so and I couldn't stay in the lab after it closed - but I will update this page once it does. </br>
