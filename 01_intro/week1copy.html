#### Week 1: Introduction

Hi! I'm James. I've been looking forward to this class for a very long time! I really appreciate being given the opportunity to come to Harvard to cut my teeth in a real machine shop.

Here's a little bit about me:

1. I currently attend boarding school in Massachusetts, but I was born in Beijing and I live in Hong Kong.

2. This might sound irrelevant, but I used to be very unfit. This caused me no shortage of problems growing up - my obesity caused me to not only have physical health problems but also neutered my self-esteem and self-respect. After picking up outdoor sports, I have dropped almost 90lbs and become physically and mentally healthier. Now, I have a passion for everything outdoors - especially mountain biking. However, after riding many mountain bikes (rentals), I couldn't help but notice a lot of them had the tendency of wanting to throw you over the bars, have twitchy handling at speed or in corners, etc. After some research, I found that the geometry and suspension design of a mountain bike have an outsized effect on its handling. I also learned that there aren't any mountain bikes being sold right now that have geometry and suspension that tick every box on what I'm looking for. I also discovered that there is a small but passionate community of people online making their own mountain bikes because of the same problems. Thanks to their encouragement, I was inspired to do the same. 

In other words, I'd like my final project to be a 3D printed (hopefully to scale) prototype of a full-suspension mountain bike frame of my own design. I realized a little too late last class that this might not be possible because of the electronics and microcontroller requirements for the final project. If I can't do a mountain bike as my final project, I'd like to make a remote-controlled dropper seatpost that can be replenished with batteries you can buy from a convenience store. There is currently only one option for remote-controlled dropper seatposts on the market, and it is $800 and uses a proprietary battery.
