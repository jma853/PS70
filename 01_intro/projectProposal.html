#### Project Proposal

<h1>Idea 1: Long-travel Gearbox MTB Frame</h1>

<strong><u><b>Problems:</b></strong></u>

<ol>
  <li><b>Suspension Travel</b>
  
   <br> <img src="v10.png" width="500px"><img src="range.jpg" width="500px"></br>

    <br><small><i>Santa Cruz V10 (215mm travel) vs. Norco Range (180mm travel). Just bridge the gap already! </small></i></br>

    For all intents and purposes, there are two main classes of mountain bikes: ones that go uphill AND downhill, and ones that ONLY go downhill. The ones that only go downhill have historically had way more suspension travel than the ones that do both, but that gap is closing. Still, it's not quite there yet - downhill bikes still have >200mm whereas the long-travel "enduro" bikes have ~180mm at most. By the time you've reached 180mm of suspension travel, you've already sacrificed so much pedaling efficiency that you might as well bump the travel up to >200mm to gain more confidence descending (IMO). Unfortunately, no mountain bike manufacturer has made a bike like this yet.</li>

  <br><li><b>Geometry</b></br>

    <small><i>The seated climbing positions of a DH bike and enduro bike, compared</i></small>        

    Enduro bikes don't have geometry as adapted to descending as that of DH bikes; i.e. 64deg head angles vs. 62deg head angles. Conversely, DH bikes don't have geometry adapted to pedaling uphill. Their slack seattube angles, which work a wonder while descending by moving the seat out of the way of your legs, don't work well for pedaling - it puts you in a seated climbing position where you can hardly reach your bars and places most of your body weight close to the rear axle of the bike, preventing you from weighing the front wheel on climbs. The short seattubes of DH bikes also mean you usually won't be able to fit a long enough dropper in there. </li>
  
  <br><li><b>Derailleurs</b></br>

    <br><img src="bent.jpg" width="550px"><img src="pinion.jpg" width="550px"></br>

    <small><i>Derailleurs have a habit of getting bent or torn off. With nothing hanging off the back, there's nothing to smash.</i></small>

    <br>Derailleurs add unsprung mass, which worsens suspension performance, and are essentially overpriced disposable items that are one rock strike away from being bent or destroyed. Due to their low drag, they make a lot of sense for Cross-Country mountain biking, but for anything other than that, they're just too fragile to be reliable.</li></br>

  <li><b>Kinematics</b>

    <br><img src="LR.jpg"></br>

    <small><i>Leverage ratio graphs. Progressive leverage ratio shown in green.</i></small>

    <br><i>a. Progressivity</i> - the increase in force required to compress the shock as the bike goes deeper into its suspension travel - is the determining factor for how a bike's suspension performs downhill. A progressive leverage ratio that follows a straight line can override badly-set up/cheap suspension, making for good small-bump absorption and a predictable ride. Unfortunately, many enduro bikes still have leverage ratios that are too linear (largely because many consumers complain that it is too hard to use full travel upon first getting their bike), meaning that riders have to spend an inordinate amount of time setting up their suspension to compensate for that.</br>

    <i>b. Anti-squat</i> - the amount of resistance a bike's suspension has to compressing (squatting) under pedaling - largely determines its efficiency uphill. Modern enduro bikes have good anti-squat (typically a little above 100%, which does a pretty good job of negating pedal squat), meaning they're pretty good for going uphill (relative to how much suspension travel they have). The anti-squat of DH bikes, however, is not optimized for pedaling uphill. 

    <br><i>c. Anti-rise</i> determines suspension performance under braking. At 100% anti-rise, your rear suspension does not compress or rise during braking - in effect, it stiffens up, keeping your bike's dynamic geometry while braking more or less the same at the cost of braking traction. At <100% anti-rise, your rear suspension rises during braking, staying high and active in its travel, allowing it to absorb bumps at the cost of upseting your bike's dynamic geometry. I prefer anti-rises around 50-60%, but no commercially available gearbox-equipped mountain bikes have an anti-rise that low.</br>
  </li>
</ol>

<b>Solutions:</b>

1. Design an enduro bike with the same amount of suspension as DH bikes (>200mm).

2. ...which also has geometry like that of a DH bike's.

3. Other than DH bikes' overly slack seattube angles.

4. Use a GEARBOX. There are so many advantages: it's a fully sealed system (no more bent or broken derailleurs!), has far longer service intervals, is generally easier to service, has completely consistent anti-squat, and - most importantly - significantly reduces unsprung mass, making your suspension perform far better. Your bike will have more traction/stick to the ground better. The only disadvantage is some extra drag, but when you're just grinding your way up fire roads to  extended descents (as opposed to rapidly ratcheting your cranks up a technical climb), it's not a big deal.

5. Design a bike that has a DH bike-like leverage ratio and anti-squat high enough to pedal.

Idea 2: Automatically Adjusting Dropper Post

Preface:
Dropper seatposts have revolutionized mountain biking. By allowing users to quickly toggle between seattube lengths for a given incline, climbing and descending are now infinitely easier and safer.

Problem:
1. Toggling between seattube lengths is not an exact science. Human error in using the dropper post lever can cost valuable seconds in a race - especially an XC race, which is comprised largely of rolling terrain where you need to constantly adjust your seattube length. 
2. Some riders may have thumb injuries, meaning they cannot use the dropper post lever without pain. 

Solution:
A self-adjusting dropper post that adjusts its length depending on how much pressure it detects on the front and rear wheel. 
Ex. As you place weight on the front wheel while climbing, the seatpost will raise itself up. As you place more weight on the rear wheel while descending, the seatpost will lower itself.
