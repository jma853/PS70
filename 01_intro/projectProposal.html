#### Project Proposal

Idea 1: Long-travel gearbox MTB frame

Problems:
1. Long-travel enduro MTBs typically cap at 170mm of rear suspension travel. This is still far from downhill (DH) bikes, which usually have at least 200mm. IMO once you go beyond 160mm of rear travel you've already sacrificed most of your uphill agility for downhill capability, so you might as well go all in and get the travel up to DH bike levels.
2. Most enduro bikes also don't have geometry as adapted to descending as that of DH bikes.
3. That said, you can't just make a super capable enduro bike by just slapping a wide-range drivetrain and dropper post onto a DH bike. DH bikes' seattube angles are too slack to comfortably pedal. 
4. Derailleurs. They add unsprung mass, which makes your suspension perform worse, and by hanging off the back of your bike, act as disposable items that are one bad rock strike away from being replaced. Despite this, they still cost an arm and a leg... Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of enduro *and* DH bikes still use them.
5. Kinematics: Many enduro bikes still have leverage ratios that are too linear IMO. Although DH bikes have better leverage ratios, their anti-squat levels are not adapted to pedaling in a 32T chainring, making their pedaling performance questionable. 

Solutions:
1. Design an enduro bike with the same amount of suspension as DH bikes (>200mm).
2. ...which also has geometry like that of a DH bike's.
3. Other than DH bikes' overly slack seattube angles.
4. Use a GEARBOX. There are so many advantages: it's a fully sealed system (no more bent or broken derailleurs!), has far longer service intervals, is generally easier to service, has completely consistent anti-squat, and - most importantly - significantly reduces unsprung mass, making your suspension perform far better. Your bike will have more traction/stick to the ground better. The only disadvantage is some extra drag, but when you're just grinding your way up fire roads to  extended descents (as opposed to rapidly ratcheting your cranks up a technical climb), it's not a big deal.
5. Design a bike that has a DH bike-like leverage ratio and anti-squat high enough to pedal.

Idea 2: Automatically Adjusting Dropper Post

Preface:
Dropper seatposts have revolutionized mountain biking. By allowing users to quickly toggle between seattube lengths for a given incline, climbing and descending are now infinitely easier and safer.

Problem:
1. Toggling between seattube lengths is not an exact science. Human error in using the dropper post lever can cost valuable seconds in a race - especially an XC race, which is comprised largely of rolling terrain where you need to constantly adjust your seattube length. 
2. Some riders may have thumb injuries, meaning they cannot use the dropper post lever without pain. 

Solution:
A self-adjusting dropper post that adjusts its length depending on how much pressure it detects on the front and rear wheel. 
Ex. As you place weight on the front wheel while climbing, the seatpost will raise itself up. As you place more weight on the rear wheel while descending, the seatpost will lower itself.
