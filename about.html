### About Me

Hi, I'm James! I am a student from Hong Kong who currently lives in Massachusetts. 

My hobbies are riding bikes, playing drums, and stressing out over college applications.

Riding bikes, especially mountain biking, is one of my biggest passions and has great personal significance to me because it helped me overcome my lifelong obesity and health problems. As corny as this sounds, I truly believe that mountain bikes can help us live healthier, happier lives - I hope that I can design something that makes mountain biking more accessible as a way to give back.
